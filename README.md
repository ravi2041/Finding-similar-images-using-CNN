# Image_Similarity_module
I have developed a deep learning model using MASK-RCNN and pretrain CNN model (Incepton V3) to find similar images as a part of university project. I have exploited Mask-RCNN concept link is https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN. Open source software has been used. Please feel free to use this method and add on new methods to the existing approach.



The following images are the output images of insect which our model has given.

The first insect is input image and the rest of the images are output predicted by our model. There are basically two output based on two conditions which we tested and based on their genres and other factors we have tested the conditions.

This output is based on the insect genre which we have given some threshold based on multiple test conducted.

These are other examples where we are testing with other insects.
