# Image_Similarity_module
I have developed a deep learning model using MASK-RCNN and pretrain CNN model (Incepton V3) to find similar images as a part of university project. I have exploited Mask-RCNN concept link is https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN. Open source software has been used. Please feel free to use this method and add on new methods to the existing approach.
