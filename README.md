# Finding Similar Images
Deep learning model using MASK-RCNN and pretrain CNN model (Incepton V3) to find similar images as a part of university project. I have exploited Mask-RCNN concept link is https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN. Open source software has been used. Please feel free to use this method and add on new methods to the existing approach.



The following images are the output images of insect which our model has given.

The first image is input and the rest of the images are output predicted by model. There are basically two output based on certain conditions which were tested and validated.

This output is based on the insect genre chosen on some threshold based on multiple test conducted.
